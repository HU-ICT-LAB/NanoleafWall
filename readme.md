##    How to use Branches
       ** Master **> Master branche is the mainbranche of the project. You may only merge a feature branche when you feature works propperly. Master branche may not include testfiles.
        ** Feature\[name] **> By produce a new part of the product, by example a new button, always make a new Feature\[name]. You could say that you can use the name of your userstory, or a part of it. Only when its small enough. When you merged the Feature, and it work propperly delete the feature branche.
        ** Test\[just something] **> It speaks for it self. When you want to try something make a branche for it. Push and pull it to this branche. A test or a prototype may NEVER merged to the Master branche. When you want to use a part of a test, export it to a file in the Feature\ branche.
